        <p className="colortext xl:text-lg space-y-5 tracking-wide leading-7 pt-3 mobile:text-sm">ðŸš€ Welcome to my vibrant world of Full Stack Development, where I combine my coding prowess with the discipline of bodybuilding and the agility of Badminton. Just as I sculpt websites with precision, I sculpt my physique, drawing inspiration from real-life titans like David Goggins and Iman Gadzhi, and fueling my boundless curiosity for self-improvement. While I relish diving deep into the pages of books and exploring the art of finance with the gusto of a Hollywood investor, I'm equally passionate about delving into the cutting-edge realm of Defense Technology. Think of me as your visionary director, crafting web experiences that shine brighter than Hollywood stars and ensuring your digital presence is a cinematic masterpiece. Together, let's script the next tech blockbuster and embark on an epic journey where code meets creativity, and every line of code is a scene-stealer! ðŸŒŸðŸ’ª <Link href='/Contact'  className="font-bold">Contact me</Link>
